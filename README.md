# NTHU CS4520 Introduction to Image Processing

This repository contains my code for the 4 assignments in CS4520 Introduction to Image Processing, \
taught by Prof. Chiou-Ting Hsu at National Tsing Hua University. \
These assignments come from [DIP 3/e Student Projects](https://www.imageprocessingplace.com/DIP-3E/dip3e_student_projects.htm) provided by the textbook *Digital Image Processing 4th Edition* (Gonzalez and Woods, 2018).
